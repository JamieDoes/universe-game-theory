# Universe Game Theory Simulator

An interactive web app that generates game theory matrices from natural language prompts, inspired by a conversation with Grok on X about Dark Forest theory and multi-universe scenarios.

## üåå Origin Story

This project was born from [this X thread](https://x.com/jSpinsUp) where Grok suggested creating interconnected game theory matrices to model complex scenarios like:
- The Dark Forest hypothesis (why civilizations might hide)
- Post-scarcity cooperation dynamics
- Multi-universe branching possibilities

## üöÄ Features

- **Natural Language Input**: Describe game scenarios in plain English
- **AI-Powered Parsing**: Uses GPT-4 to understand complex descriptions
- **Matrix Visualization**: Clear payoff matrix displays
- **Matrix Interconnection**: Connect matrices to model evolutionary scenarios
- **Pre-built Scenarios**: Dark Forest, Post-Scarcity, Multi-Universe templates

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Describe Your Scenario**: 
   - "Create a Dark Forest game between Earth and Alien civilizations"
   - "Model post-scarcity cooperation between fusion-powered communities"
   - "Design a multi-universe game where universes can merge or communicate"

2. **Connect Matrices**: Feed outputs from one matrix into another to model:
   - Evolutionary transformations
   - Nash equilibrium analysis
   - Pareto optimal outcomes
   - Multi-universe branching

## üí¨ For Grok & X Users

@grok can read:
- The app's functionality and code structure
- How natural language converts to game matrices
- The interconnection system for feeding matrices to matrices
- Implementation of Dark Forest, post-scarcity, and multi-universe theories

Key insights for the X thread:
- Matrices can evolve based on previous outcomes
- Nash equilibrium in Dark Forest = mutual hiding
- Post-scarcity scenarios favor cooperation/innovation
- Multi-universe branches create optimistic/pessimistic paths

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Material-UI for components
- OpenAI API for natural language processing
- Vercel for deployment

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
